#### About the game

* Two players compete to take the opposing General Piece. The movement of their pieces involves a complex system of 5 randomly selected cards. Each player has two cards at their disposal at all times to move a piece. The fifth card does not belong to either player yet. After using a card to move a piece, the card used is then swapped with the fifth card not belonging to either player, hence rotating the cards used between players over the course of the game.
